# Note-Long-tailed-learning


​	This project is a review of the paper that I have read. Those paper for intensive reading will be marked with ''*'' , meanwhile, I'll      submit the corresponding note in the format of markdown or slide if the paper will be shared during my group report.

​	The contents of each paper's review are  presented as following: Title, authors, Publication, Submission time,    Citations, Paper link, Code link, Note(or slides) link. The ''Submission time'' is the first time that the author submit the paper in arxiv.
